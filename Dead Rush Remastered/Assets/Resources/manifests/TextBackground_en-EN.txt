The year is 2048.
The CIS countries were almost completely destroyed by a nuclear bomb dropped by the United States during the war...
Was destroyed...
100% - Ukraine
98% - Russia
99% - Moldova
100% - Belarus
And no less went to other countries...
In the course of dropping the bomb, US citizens began to strike, demanding the abandonment of the government... In the end, the government collapsed...
But the consequences of the explosion were colossal, this led to the radioactive manifestations of the fauna, and influenced the corpses, which for some reason resurrected... And then they mutated into something strange and terrible... in zombies... And now, now they wander through the cities, and the survivors are trying to save their skin from these dead.
Although Ukraine was not completely destroyed, its government wanted to take some territories of other countries, but hordes of zombies and citizens broke the offensive, and the country could not stand the infected.
Now no one knows if a bright future will come for these countries...
